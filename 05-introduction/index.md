# Introduction

Organisations tend to require a consultant's input when they're at an inflexion point. When they know they need to make a change but don't know how to make it happen.

These points of change happen throughout an organisation's lifecycle:

- When they're starting up
- When they're going from startup to scaleup
- When the current ways of working have reached the end of their useful life
- When looking at new or wider markets
- When a crisis is about to happen
- When organisations merge

The generalist IT consultant's role is usually to translate between technical and non-technical audiences during these points of change:

- Writing business cases and proposals
- Designing solutions and roadmaps to get there
- Leading IT procurement exercises
- Project managing software implementations
- Setting up systems and processes
- Coaching and training

This toolkit is designed for people taking on that role, often as internal consultants, and often with very little support.
