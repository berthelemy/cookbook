# Initial contact

The first conversation is a chance to get to know the client and to start to explore their problem(s).

Try using these open-ended questions. Although remember to do your research before the conversation. It always looks better.

1. What are you about? What do you do and why?
2. What are the problems you're experiencing that you want my help with?
3. How big are those problems? (If you can quantify them in some way that's incredibly useful)
4. What have you tried already?
5. What are you hoping to achieve?

At this point, you may all decide that perhaps you're not the right person for the job. That's fine. It's best to acknowledge that early on.

## Exploring the problem

Once you're ready to go further, then it's time to explore the problem in more detail. Pick and choose from these questions:

- How many people does the problem affect? Are they all internal to the organisation?
- What does success look like for these people?
- What does success look like for the organisation?
- How do you currently address the problem?
- What is working?
- What isn't working?

Make the important measurable, not the measurable important.

## Looking at the context

And then looking further at the organisation and its context:

- How is your organisation structured?
- Who are your "customers" (in the widest sense)
- What IT systems do you currently have in place across the organisation?
- How do people access the IT? (Networks, wifi, VPN)
- Do you have single sign-on in place?

One of the most common requests I get is to help people and organisations define their requirements for a technology solution - whether it's a solution that they're going to sell to paying customers, or one for an internal audience. This might then lead to creating a board-level proposal, leading a procurement process, or managing a project to build a new product.

Adapted from [Roman Pichler's Product Vision Board](https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/product-vision-board/):

- What is your vision for the thing you're creating? (The product)
- Why do you want to make it?
- Who will be using the product? (The users)
- Who will pay for the product? (The customers)
- What problems will the product solve for the users and the customers?
- What is special about your product? Are there off-the-shelf solutions that would work just as well?
- What will you and/or your organisation benefit from creating the solution?

Adapted from [Ash Maurya's Running Lean](https://leanstack.com/running-lean-book):

- What assumptions are you making?
- What are your riskiest assumptions?
- What would be the impact if those assumptions were wrong?
- How can you validate those risky assumptions, without burning through your funds?

Based on my experience of digital transformation:

- How will you know you've succeeded?
- In that future state, from the first time you "touch" a user or customer, through to the point at which you have solved their problem, what people, processes and technology will you need to have in place?
- What data do you need to collect to measure success and to identify problems early?

## Next steps

Whilst we probably won't go much beyond the first few questions in the first meeting, they should help paint a picture of where I am likely to take you.

The rest will form the basis of a series of workshops with key stakeholders.
