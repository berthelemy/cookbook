# Initial contact

The first conversation is a chance to get to know the client and to start to explore their problem(s).

Try using these open-ended questions. Although remember to do your research before the conversation. It always looks better.

1. What are you about? What do you do and why?
2. What are the problems you're experiencing that you want my help with?
3. How big are those problems? (If you can quantify them in some way that's incredibly useful)
4. What have you tried already?
5. What are you hoping to achieve?

At this point, you may all decide that perhaps you're not the right person for the job. That's fine. It's best to acknowledge that early on.
