# Exploring the problem

Once you're ready to go further, then it's time to explore the problem in more detail. Pick and choose from these questions:

- How many people does the problem affect? Are they all internal to the organisation?
- What does success look like for these people?
- What does success look like for the organisation?
- How do you currently address the problem?
- What is working?
- What isn't working?
- In that future state, from the first time you "touch" a user or customer, through to the point at which you have solved their problem, what people, processes and technology will you need to have in place?
- What data do you need to collect to measure success and to identify problems early?

{: .note }
Make the important measurable, not the measurable important.
