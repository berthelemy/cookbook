# Product development

Adapted from [Ash Maurya's Running Lean](https://leanstack.com/running-lean-book):

- What assumptions are you making?
- What are your riskiest assumptions?
- What would be the impact if those assumptions were wrong?
- How can you validate those risky assumptions, without burning through your funds?
