Whether you're in a public-sector organisation, a charity or private company,before you embark on choosing new technology, you need to know what you have already.

Your organization's technology landscape encompasses all the tools, software, hardware, and systems you use to carry out your operations.

I tend to classify these as:

- Infrastructure
- Operational
- Specialist
- Governance

Each of these will be important to you as you select your new technology.

Listed below you'll find a number of questions to ask as part of your technology landscape review. For the most part, you'll be talking to your IT colleagues. In doing so, you'll be creating a valuable ally for your future procurement and implementation projects.

## Infrastructure

Typically, an organisation's IT infrastructure includes components such as:

- devices - the machines used by people to access organisational systems
- networks - how people connect from inside and outside the office
- authentication - often known as Single Sign On or SSO, using an Identity Provider (IdP) system
- anti-virus and anti-intruder - the systems that alert you to problems
- firewalls - designed to prevent unauthorised access

### Questions to ask

- Can people inside the organisation's network access systems and resources based on the internet?
- Can people use their own devices to access organisational systems? If so, do they have to go through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or can they go directly to the system provider?
- Do we have a single-sign on system? If so, what do we use for our Identity Provider?


## Operational

- email and calendars
- collaboration
- file sharing
- data warehousing - where data goes to be analysed)

## Governance

- What's the process to allow an external system to use our Identity Provider?

## Getting started

Make friends with your IT team. They will thank you for involving them early on. They'll be able to tell you about the core systems, and will help you set some of the standards for your new technology.

**Take Inventory**

Next, conduct a comprehensive inventory of your organization's technology assets. This includes software applications, hardware devices, data storage, network infrastructure, and more. Make a list of everything currently in use, from the computers in your office to the software your employees rely on.

**Evaluate Performance**

Assess the performance of your technology tools and systems. Are there any frequent glitches, slowdowns, or downtime issues? Identify areas where technology is helping and where it might be hindering productivity or efficiency.

**Consider Cybersecurity**

Cybersecurity is a critical aspect of any technology landscape. Review your organization's security measures, including firewalls, antivirus software, and employee training programs. Are there any vulnerabilities that need addressing to protect sensitive data?

**Assess Compatibility and Integration**

Determine how well your technology components work together. Are there any compatibility issues between different software applications or hardware devices? Evaluate whether integrating certain systems might improve efficiency and data flow.

**Review Costs**

Examine your technology-related expenses, including software licenses, maintenance, and hardware upgrades. Are there opportunities to reduce costs while maintaining or improving your technology landscape?

**Gather Feedback**

Don't forget to seek input from employees who use these technologies daily. Their insights can provide valuable perspectives on what's working well and what needs improvement.

**Consider Future Needs**

Technology is constantly evolving. Consider your organization's future needs and how your technology landscape can adapt to meet them. Are there emerging technologies that could benefit your business, such as automation or artificial intelligence?

**Prioritize and Plan**

Based on your findings, prioritize the areas that need attention. Create an action plan outlining steps to address the identified issues and align your technology with your goals. Be sure to allocate resources and assign responsibilities accordingly.

**Implement Changes**

Once you've established a plan, begin implementing the necessary changes gradually. Monitor progress and make adjustments as needed. Remember that technology is a tool to support your organization's goals, so changes should align with your overall strategy.

**Regularly Update Your Review**

Technology is dynamic, so your review should be an ongoing process. Schedule regular check-ins to assess progress, address new challenges, and stay up-to-date with the latest technological advancements.

In conclusion, reviewing your organization's technology landscape is a vital practice for staying competitive and efficient in today's digital age. By following these steps and involving key stakeholders, you can ensure that your technology aligns with your goals and provides a solid foundation for success, even if you're not a tech expert.
